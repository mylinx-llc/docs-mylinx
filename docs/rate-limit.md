# Rate Limits

In order to maintain an efficient, secure, and high-performing API, Mylinx places limits on the amount of data that can be consumed in any given period.


## 429 Error: Rate Limiting
* Rate Limit: 2 requests per second.
* Burst Capacity: 5 requests.

If you exceed the rate limit or burst capacity, you'll receive a 429 error and need to wait.

For Mylinx Support, include:
* Your usage of the Mylinx API.
* The API endpoints you're using.
* An estimate of your 24-hour request volume.
* Your Mylinx account email.
